This application is supposed to search for a specific relationship between primes and pallindromes

Apparently for a given palindrome n can satisfy the equation (n*24)+1 == p^2 where p is prime

What are those palindromes and primes? 

That's what we're going to find out!

I wrote this quickly in python and now again in golang using a few prime generating tricks
